REFACTOR BRANCH - WIP: WORK IN PROGRESS

Picking on Tejas Gupta's (https://github.com/TGNYC) `Space Invaders` (source code: https://gist.github.com/TGNYC/40f814389ba35fdf41b41858f7ce6cae), I wanted to refactor the code and expand some functionalities.

The first tasl will consist on pure refactor, maintaing the original funcionalities, but splitting the code into several specific thematic files such as player.py, enemy.py, etc., to make files shorter and (hopefully) more readable.

The rendering logic will then be adapted to allow faster and animation and thus more elements such as enemies, debris, etc.
(Check https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#animation-control).

Additionaly, new functionalities will be added, namely game levels — more, faster and heterogeneous enemies — multiple shots, etc.

Finally, I will try to make alternative renderings such as ASCII or PyGame, but for that the render engine needs to be nicely isolated.


Please share your ideas and code.
